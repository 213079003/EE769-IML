Study and Experiments on Neural Networks and Clustering
- We modified pre-existing CNN training code to classify bees versus ants to run on Google CoLab to test learning rate and momentum and added weight decay for regularization. 
- We preprocessed data for clustering using various transforms and trained and visualized the effect of k in k-means clustering.
- We trained principal component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on the variance explained.
- We trained kernel principal component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on the variance explained.
