# Study and Experiments on Neural Networks and Clustering
- The [notebook](https://github.com/213079003/EE769-IML/blob/main/Assignment3/213070015_213079003_1.ipynb) deals with image classification using transfer learning of a ResNet-18 architecture that is pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet).
    - Finetuning this model to classify bees versus ants by varying learning rate and momentum. Then added weight decay for regularization improving the testing accuracy from 94% to 96% .

- 
- We preprocessed data for clustering using various transforms and trained and visualized the effect of k in k-means clustering.
- We trained principal component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on the variance explained.
- We trained kernel principal component analysis and selected the number of dimensions based on the variance explained.
